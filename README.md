The applet code that can be run as an add-on with the Unitraverse platform will probably look and behave much like the built-in applets. The code for the built-ins can serve as a guide for creating your own addons.

Also there is a video demonstration of these 4 basic built-ins in the following video link. It will give you the basic look and feel of the platform interface and perhaps also provide a sense of how powerful this platform may soon become. The demo video can be found here:
