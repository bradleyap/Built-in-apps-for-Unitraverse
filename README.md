The applet code that can be run as an add-on with the Unitraverse platform will probably look and behave much like the built-in applets. The code for the built-ins can serve as a guide for creating your own addons.

Also there is a video demonstration of these 4 basic built-ins in the following video link. It will give you the basic look and feel of the platform interface and perhaps also provide a sense of how powerful this platform may soon become. The demo video can be found here:

These applets work with the latest public version of Unitraverse which is 1.4.265. Very soon there will be some breaking changes that will require that most applets are also updated. Just downloading the current version of the applets I've written along with the Unitraverse update is an easy fix, but if you are writing your own applets, the more recent API changes will require updates to your code. The sample apps, once again, will be the most helpful reference, at least until the documentation gets updated.
